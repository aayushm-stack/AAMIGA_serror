    sourceText: 'Charaka Samhita, Sutrasthana 11.35',
    commentaryReference: 'Chakrapani Datta, Ayurveda Dipika on Charaka Sutrasthana 11.35',
    literalMeaning:
      'There are three foundational subsidiary pillars (Trayopastambha) of life: Ahara (intake), Nidra (sleep), and Brahmacharya (restraint/energy conservation). Just as a building is supported by its pillars, physical and mental stability is sustained by what we consume, how deeply we rest, and how effectively we conserve our vital energy.',
    practicalModernApplication:
      'This is why the Daily Sadhana check-in tracks screen time right next to food and sleep. Just like junk food crashes the body, junk digital content crashes the mind. This feature trains you to treat your digital attention with the exact same care as your physical diet.',

    sourceText: 'Patanjali Yoga Sutras 2.38',
    commentaryReference: 'Vyasa Bhashya on Patanjali Yoga Sutra 2.38',
    literalMeaning:
      'Upon being firmly established in Brahmacharya (sensory restraint and disciplined focus), one attains profound vitality and vigor (Virya). By deliberately withdrawing attention from endless digital fragmentation and overstimulation, you reclaim the mental stamina required for true self-mastery.',
    practicalModernApplication:
      'Think of your attention like a battery. The Energy Conservation slider exists because true focus isn\'t just about logging hours at a desk—it\'s about how well you protect your mental charge from draining notifications and digital noise.',

    sourceText: 'Bhagavad Gita 2.62-63',
    commentaryReference: 'Adi Shankaracharya Bhashya on Bhagavad Gita 2.62-63',
    literalMeaning:
      'Dwelling on sensory objects breeds attachment; attachment births craving; craving obstructed becomes agitation. Agitation leads to delusion, which ultimately destroys the discriminative intellect (Buddhi). This reveals the precise psychology of distraction: failure begins at the subtlest first thought, and intercepting the impulse early is the only way to prevent a complete loss of control.',
    practicalModernApplication:
      'Ever open your phone to check the time and suddenly lose an hour? That’s the distraction snowball. The Pause Gate Visualizer shows exactly where you are in that 7-step loop, helping you catch a fleeting urge before it completely overrides your intellect.',

    commentaryReference: 'Vyasa Bhashya on Patanjali Yoga Sutra 2.33',
    literalMeaning:
      'When the mind is afflicted by unwholesome thoughts or destructive impulses (vitarkas), one should deliberately cultivate the exact opposite, wholesome perspective (Pratipaksha Bhavana). This active cognitive reframing cuts the root of toxic loops by redirecting mental energy (Chitta Vritti) rather than merely suppressing it.',
    practicalModernApplication:
      'You can\'t just delete a bad habit; you have to overwrite it. Instead of just locking you out of an app, the Interceptor asks you to pause, acknowledge the negative urge, and type a better alternative to actively rewire your brain.',

    sourceText: 'Bhagavad Gita 6.17',
    commentaryReference: 'Adi Shankaracharya Bhashya on Bhagavad Gita 6.17',
    literalMeaning:
      'For one who is moderate in eating and recreation, balanced in effort at work, and regulated in sleep and waking, yoga removes all sorrow. True discipline is not extreme asceticism or self-punishment; it is finding sustainable harmony in daily routines.',
    practicalModernApplication:
      'This is the exact logic behind the app\'s Yukta Scoring algorithm. The app doesn\'t demand 14 hours of study and zero entertainment. It rewards you for balanced sleep (6.5 to 8 hours), mindful digital boundaries, and sustainable daily focus.',

    sourceText: 'Katha Upanishad 1.3.3-4',
    commentaryReference: 'Shankara Bhashya on Katha Upanishad 1.3.3-4',
    literalMeaning:
      'The human body is a chariot, the intellect (Buddhi) is the charioteer, the mind (Manas) acts as the reins, and the senses (Indriyas) are the wild horses. If the intellect is asleep and the mind lacks restraint, the sensory horses run wild and drag the chariot off course.',

    commentaryReference: 'Shankara Bhashya on Taittiriya Upanishad 2.2 & Yoga Sutra 2.49',
    literalMeaning:
      'Beyond the physical body (Annamaya Kosha) lies the vital energy sheath (Pranamaya Kosha), governed by the breath (Prana). Because the breath acts as the physical bridge to the mental sheath (Manomaya Kosha), regulating respiration directly stabilizes an agitated mind.',
    practicalModernApplication:
      'This anchors the Breathing Sanctum. When you are overwhelmed, logic and reading don\'t always work. The expanding and contracting concentric rings bypass the thinking brain, using paced rhythms to mechanically slow your heart rate and restore calm.',

    sourceText: 'Yoga Sutra 1.33',
    commentaryReference: 'Vyasa Bhashya on Patanjali Yoga Sutra 1.33',
    literalMeaning:
      'The mind is purified and pacified (Chitta Prasadanam) by cultivating friendliness (Maitri) toward the happy, compassion (Karuna) for the suffering, joy (Mudita) toward the virtuous, and equanimity (Upeksha) toward the wicked or toxic. Practicing these specific attitudes acts as a social shield, actively dissolving modern interpersonal frictions.',
    practicalModernApplication:
      'Social media FOMO and peer comparison can easily ruin a good day. The Bhava Compass acts as your emotional reset button. When you feel triggered or stressed by others, it gives you quick journaling prompts to drop the negativity and get your peace back.',

    literalMeaning:
      'Sattva (clarity/light), Rajas (passion/agitation), and Tamas (inertia/dullness)—these three qualities born of material nature condition the embodied self. Upon the firm establishment of regulated conduct (Brahmacharya), unshakeable cognitive vitality and vigor (Virya) is attained.',
